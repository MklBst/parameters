Grammar v3
----------

Grammar `v3` is a great revamp of the grammar, not backwards compatible with previous grammar versions. There are many changes, not all described here, but here are the main ideas:
* Removal of the `firstLaunch` field (that content stays hardcoded in the app, and the `tipiQuestionnaire` has disappeared)
* Generalization of probes into *sequences*, which can represent either probes or questionnaires. Sequences are a structured way of ordering questions, with several levels are hierarchy: *pageGroups*, *pages*, and *questions*.
* Separation of the *definition of questions* from the definitions of *sequences of questions*.
* More flexibility in positioning: the ideas of "fixed" and "floating" remain, but this applies at each level of the sequence hierarchy. Additionally, items (be they page groups, pages, or questions) can be positioned *after* other named items.
* Pages and page groups can also be marked as "bonus", i.e. skippable by the user.
* There are 3 new question types: `matrixChoice`, `autoList`, and `manySliders`.

Grammar v2.1
------------

Grammar `v2.1` is a backward compatible extension of grammar `v2`, with added fields. In the root node:
* `backendExpId`: a *string* defining the identity of the experiment for the backend.
* `backendDbName`: a *string* defining the name of the database to upload the results to in the backend.
* `expDuration`: an *integer* defining the duration before publication of results if users use the app as intented.
* `backendApiUrl`: a *string* defining the url of the backend API.
* `resultsPageUrl`: a *string* defining the url of the results page.
* `firstLaunch`: a JSON *object* containing a detailed description of the textual content of the views to be displayed at the first launch of the application as well as a description of the questionnaire questions they may contain.
1. `firstLaunch` is a JSON *object* with fields:
  * `welcomeText`: a *string* containing the text to be displayed in the Welcoming screen of the app.
  * `descriptionText`: a *string* containing the text to be displayed in the Description screen of the app.
  * `tipiQuestionnaire`: a JSON *object* defining the personality questionnaire to be displayed at first launch of the app.
2. In `firstLaunch`, there is a new `tipiQuestionnaire` *object* with fields:
  * `text`: a *string* containing the header description of the questionnaire.
  * `hintsForAllSubQuestions`: a *list* of *strings* containing the hints along the range of the slider answer of the questions of the questionnaire.
  * `subQuestions`: a *list* of JSON *objects* formatted as `tipiQuestion`s.
3. In `tipiQuestionnaire`, a `tipiQuestion` is an *object* with fields:
  * `text`: a *string* containing the question.
  * `initialPosition`: an optional *integer* defining the initial position of the slider.

Grammar v2
----------

Grammar `v2` is essentially the same as grammar `v1`, with the following four changes (the first three render it backwards-incompatible):
* `version` in the root object is now a *string*, allowing for version names like `test-1`, `qa-1`, `prod-1`.
* The misnamed `showHints` has been renamed to `showLiveIndication`.
* The misnamed `nSlotsPerPoll` has been renamed to `nSlotsPerProbe`.
* There are two new *mandatory* properties in the root object:
  * `schedulingMinDelay`: an *integer* defining the minimal delay between two probes (in seconds).
  * `schedulingMeanDelay`: an *integer* defining the average delay between two probes (in seconds).
